Viscera had spilled out and steamed in the fresh morning light.\n\nA rib jutted from the wound, white and gleaming.\n\nEris unsheathed her sword. She could have a trophy. Just this. Hadn't Shaxx dragged a skull twice his size back to the City? She laid the blade's edge against the creature's rib. The bone chipped her sword and took its due, before releasing a sliver of the Ahamkara's remains.\n\nA piece of bone lay at her feet.
